One caution, though, is that different datasets can have identical or nearly identical descriptive statistics and yet the data can be significantly different. For an example of this phenomenon, research Anscombe’s Quartet. You should find four datasets and the associated visualizations. It’s the visualizations that convince you the datasets are quite different. In an exercise in a later chapter, you’ll create these visualizations."
